Bayes theorem in decision making


Bayes theorem - The confusing relation that you were introduced to in high school probability class, which made you say, "When am I going to use any of this in life?"

This blog post in my journey about learning Bayes theorem to score high in my math test, then forgetting it for the next decade, only to painfully be reminded that it could have been useful in life after all.

But to tell that story, I must first tell you what happened to me in the year 2017.

2017

The year of the #MeToo movement, the year that US logged out of the Paris Accords on Climate Change and the year the modern poet **Luis Fonsi** released his single *Despacito*!

For me personally, it was the year I was rocking in my first job after college as a project manager at Cisco Systems, learned business-level french in 6 months and learned how to juggle three balls (in increasing order of importance)

But the city I was living in, Bangalore, was not living up to it's expectations.
Usually known as the *city of rivers*, Bangalore saw record increase in pollution, warming and water contamination.

The worsening state of the city had a negative effect on me squarely, as simple jogs around my neighbourhood left me with a perpectually stuffed nose, and breathing difficulties.

All this took a turn for the worse at the end of the year, as I woke up one sunday morning, not being able to breathe at all!

A visit to the emergency room at a nearby hospital, turned out to be a recipe for disaster, as the emergency physician suggested that I should consider a nasal correction surgery, to aide my breathing.

This seemed like the *holy grail* solution, and as a degree holder of engineering, made complete sense! If the nasal canal is choked, why not just steam roll through it and make space for air?

In December, as my company prepared for a *end of year* shutdown, I met the first Otarylaryngolist (try that tongue twister) I could find, and within two days, I was in a hospital gown, ready for surgery!

At that time, it fit! A surgery with a recovery time for 5 days, and I'd be all set to go back to Bangalore and rock 2018!

20/20 hindsight, has me wondering how the hell did a take it so lighty?

## Post Surgery

The surgery apparently was a success, but I had huge stuffings on my nose. I spent two days breathing from my mouth, and finally after painfully waiting for what seemed like a decade, my nose was cleared and ready to pump air!

Well, like, the returns on that *hotshot stock* sold to you by a rather smooth trader, I didn't feel much different.

My questions were politely ignored, and the doctor said it takes about 4 weeks for full function to return. 

January was upon me, and my optimism was decaying exponentially.

Surprisingly, the rather accomplismed Otarylaryngogoloist (best you couldn't still say it),
